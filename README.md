# IoT Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of Internet of Things (IoT) projects using ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers. Each project demonstrates different aspects of IoT development, from basic hardware control to web interfaces and cloud connectivity.

## Projects Overview

This repository is organized by microcontroller type, with each project having its own dedicated folder and documentation.

### ESP8266 Projects

Explore the `/ESP-8266/` directory for projects using the ESP8266 microcontroller. Each project folder contains its own README with detailed information.

### ESP32 Projects

Explore the `/ESP-32/` directory for projects using the ESP32 microcontroller. Each project folder contains its own README with detailed information.

### Project Structure

Each project is self-contained with:
- Source code
- Detailed README
- Wiring diagrams (where applicable)
- Configuration instructions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- ESP8266 or ESP32 development board
- USB cable for programming
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO (depending on the project)
  - PlatformIO is recommended for Arduino framework projects
  - Arduino IDE can be used with appropriate board configurations
- For MicroPython projects: 
  - MicroPython firmware flashed to your device
  - A tool to upload files (like `ampy`, `rshell`, or `WebREPL`)
- Basic electronics components as specified in each project

### General Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iot-projects.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the microcontroller directory you're interested in:
   - For ESP8266 projects: `cd ESP-8266/`
   - For ESP32 projects: `cd ESP-32/`

3. Choose a specific project directory and follow its README instructions for detailed setup

### Development Environment

Projects in this repository use various development environments:

- **PlatformIO Projects**:
  - Open the project folder in VSCode with PlatformIO extension
  - Configure `platformio.ini` as needed
  - Build and upload using PlatformIO commands

- **MicroPython Projects**:
  - Flash MicroPython firmware to your device
  - Upload the project files using your preferred tool
  - Connect to the device's REPL for debugging

Refer to each project's README for specific environment setup instructions.

## Project-Specific Documentation

**Important:** All project details are maintained in their respective README files, not in this main README. This approach ensures that:

1. Adding new projects doesn't require updating the main README
2. Project documentation stays close to the code
3. Each project can have its own detailed documentation

Each project folder contains its own README with detailed instructions for:
- Hardware requirements and wiring diagrams
- Software dependencies and versions
- Setup and configuration steps
- Usage instructions and examples
- Troubleshooting common issues

## License

All projects in this repository are open-source and available for personal and educational use under the MIT License unless otherwise specified in individual project folders.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to improve existing projects or add new ones are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Contribution Ideas
- Bug fixes and optimizations
- Documentation improvements
- New IoT projects using ESP8266/ESP32
- Enhancements to existing projects
