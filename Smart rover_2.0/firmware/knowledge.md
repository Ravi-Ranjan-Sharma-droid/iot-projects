## Motor Physics and Control

### DC Motor Fundamentals

DC motors operate on the principle of electromagnetic induction. When current flows through a coil in a magnetic field, a force is generated according to Fleming's Left-Hand Rule, causing rotation.

The basic DC motor equation relates voltage, speed, and torque:

\[ V = IR + k\omega \]

Where:
- V = Applied voltage (V)
- I = Current (A)
- R = Motor resistance (Ω)
- k = Motor constant
- ω = Angular velocity (rad/s)

For our 3-6V DC gear motors, the internal gearing reduces the output speed but increases torque, following the relationship:

\[ T_{output} = T_{motor} \times \text{gear ratio} \]
\[ \omega_{output} = \frac{\omega_{motor}}{\text{gear ratio}} \]

### Torque vs. RPM Relationship

DC motors exhibit an inverse relationship between torque and speed. Maximum torque occurs at stall (zero speed), while maximum speed occurs at no load (zero torque).

The torque-speed relationship can be approximated as:

\[ T = T_{stall} \times (1 - \frac{\omega}{\omega_{no-load}}) \]

Where:
- T = Torque at a given speed
- T_{stall} = Stall torque (maximum torque at zero speed)
- ω = Current angular velocity
- ω_{no-load} = No-load angular velocity (maximum speed)

For our gear motors (typically 200-300 RPM at 3V):
- No-load speed: ~200-300 RPM
- Stall torque: ~0.8-1.2 kg·cm
- Operating range: Best efficiency occurs at 70-80% of no-load speed

### Motor Current Draw

The current drawn by a DC motor is proportional to the torque it produces:

\[ I = I_{no-load} + \frac{T}{K_T} \]

Where:
- I = Current draw (A)
- I_{no-load} = Current at no load (typically 70-100mA for small gear motors)
- T = Torque being produced
- K_T = Torque constant (torque per unit current)

Critical current points for our motors:
- No-load current: ~70-100mA per motor
- Stall current: ~800-1200mA per motor
- Normal operation: ~150-300mA per motor

The L298N motor driver can handle up to 2A per channel, providing sufficient headroom for our application.

### PWM Control Principles

Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) controls motor speed by varying the duty cycle of a square wave signal:

\[ V_{average} = V_{supply} \times \text{Duty Cycle} \]

Where:
- V_{average} = Effective voltage seen by the motor
- V_{supply} = Supply voltage
- Duty Cycle = Ratio of pulse width to period (0.0 to 1.0)

PWM frequency considerations:
- Too low (< 100Hz): Audible noise and jerky motion
- Too high (> 20kHz): Switching losses in the driver
- Optimal range: 1-5kHz for small DC motors

The ESP32's LEDC peripheral provides hardware PWM with:
- 8-bit resolution (256 levels)
- Configurable frequency (we use 1000Hz)
- Multiple channels for independent motor control

## Vehicle Dynamics

### Wheel Traction

Traction is the friction force between wheels and the surface, determined by:

\[ F_{traction} = μ \times N \]

Where:
- F_{traction} = Maximum traction force (N)
- μ = Coefficient of friction
- N = Normal force (weight on the wheel) (N)

Typical coefficients of friction:
- Rubber on dry concrete: 0.7-0.9
- Rubber on wood: 0.5-0.7
- Rubber on carpet: 0.5-0.8
- Rubber on smooth tile: 0.3-0.5

To prevent wheel slip, the motor torque must not exceed the traction limit:

\[ T_{wheel} ≤ F_{traction} \times r_{wheel} \]

Where:
- T_{wheel} = Torque at the wheel
- r_{wheel} = Wheel radius

### Turning Radius Calculation

For a tank-style vehicle with differential steering, the turning radius depends on the relative speeds of the left and right wheels:

\[ R = \frac{W}{2} \times \frac{v_L + v_R}{v_L - v_R} \]

Where:
- R = Turning radius (measured to the center point between wheels)
- W = Track width (distance between left and right wheels)
- v_L = Left side wheel velocity
- v_R = Right side wheel velocity

Special cases:
- When v_L = v_R: Straight line motion (R = ∞)
- When v_L = -v_R: Spin in place (R = 0)
- When v_L = 0, v_R > 0: Pivot around left wheel (R = W/2)

### Tank-style Movement Physics

Tank-style (skid-steering) vehicles turn by creating a speed differential between left and right sides. This creates a rotational moment:

\[ M = F_L \times \frac{W}{2} - F_R \times \frac{W}{2} \]

Where:
- M = Turning moment
- F_L, F_R = Traction forces of left and right wheels
- W = Track width

The angular acceleration is:

\[ \alpha = \frac{M}{I} \]

Where:
- α = Angular acceleration
- I = Moment of inertia of the vehicle

Skid-steering requires overcoming the scrub friction of the wheels sliding laterally. This increases power consumption during turns compared to traditional steering mechanisms.

### Weight Distribution Effects

Weight distribution affects traction, acceleration, and turning:

- **Center of Gravity (CG)**: Ideally positioned at the geometric center of the vehicle and as low as possible
- **Front-Back Distribution**: Affects acceleration and braking
- **Left-Right Distribution**: Must be balanced for straight-line stability

For optimal performance:
- Place batteries centrally and low in the chassis
- Distribute electronics evenly
- Ensure all wheels bear similar weight (within 10%)

## Power Management

### Battery Capacity Estimation

Battery capacity is measured in ampere-hours (Ah) or milliampere-hours (mAh):

\[ \text{Operating time (hours)} = \frac{\text{Battery capacity (Ah)}}{\text{Current draw (A)}} \times \text{Efficiency factor} \]

For our setup with two 18650 Li-ion batteries in series (typically 2600mAh each):
- Voltage: 2 × 3.7V = 7.4V nominal (8.4V fully charged)
- Capacity: 2600mAh (2.6Ah)
- Efficiency factor: ~0.8 (accounting for non-ideal discharge)

Estimated runtime calculation example:
- Average current draw: 800mA (all systems running)
- Runtime: (2.6Ah ÷ 0.8A) × 0.8 = ~2.6 hours

### Voltage Drop Mathematics

Voltage drop across a conductor follows Ohm's Law:

\[ V_{drop} = I \times R \]

Where:
- V_{drop} = Voltage drop (V)
- I = Current (A)
- R = Resistance (Ω)

For our project, significant voltage drops can occur in:

1. **Battery internal resistance**: ~0.1-0.2Ω per cell
   - At 1A draw: 0.1-0.2V drop

2. **Wiring resistance**: For 22 AWG wire (~16 mΩ/ft)
   - At 1A through 1ft: 0.016V drop

3. **Connection resistance**: ~0.01-0.05Ω per connection
   - At 1A: 0.01-0.05V drop per connection

Total system voltage drop can be calculated as:

\[ V_{system\_drop} = I_{total} \times (R_{battery} + R_{wiring} + R_{connections}) \]

To minimize voltage drop:
- Use thicker wires for high-current paths
- Minimize wire length
- Ensure solid connections
- Add bypass capacitors near motors (100-470μF)

### Power Consumption Analysis

Component-wise power consumption:

1. **ESP32**:
   - Idle: ~40mA
   - Active with Wi-Fi: ~120-180mA
   - Deep sleep: ~10μA (not used in this project)

2. **Motors** (per motor):
   - Stalled: ~800-1200mA
   - Full speed, no load: ~70-100mA
   - Typical operation: ~150-300mA

3. **LEDs**:
   - Standard LED: ~20mA each
   - WS2812B RGB LED: ~60mA at full white per LED

4. **L298N Motor Driver**:
   - Logic circuit: ~20-30mA
   - Efficiency loss: ~1.5-2V dropout voltage

Total system power calculation:

\[ P_{total} = V_{battery} \times (I_{ESP32} + I_{motors} + I_{LEDs} + I_{driver}) \]

Power optimization strategies:
- Reduce LED brightness when battery is low
- Implement sleep modes for unused peripherals
- Use efficient motor control algorithms

### Battery Life Calculation

Battery life can be estimated using the discharge curve and load profile:

\[ \text{Battery Life (hours)} = \frac{\text{Usable Capacity (mAh)}}{\text{Average Current Draw (mA)}} \]

Where usable capacity accounts for the cutoff voltage (typically 3.0V per cell for Li-ion).

For more accurate estimation, consider the weighted average of different operation modes:

\[ I_{avg} = \sum_{i} (I_i \times D_i) \]

Where:
- I_i = Current in mode i
- D_i = Duty cycle (fraction of time spent in mode i)

Battery protection thresholds:
- Low battery warning: 3.3V per cell (6.6V total)
- Critical cutoff: 3.0V per cell (6.0V total)

## Electronics Design

### Voltage Divider Calculations

The battery monitoring system uses a voltage divider to scale the battery voltage to the ESP32's ADC range (0-3.3V):

\[ V_{out} = V_{in} \times \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \]

For our 10kΩ and 2.2kΩ resistor divider:

\[ V_{out} = V_{in} \times \frac{2.2}{10 + 2.2} \approx V_{in} \times 0.18 \]

This scales the maximum battery voltage (8.4V) to approximately 1.5V, well within the ESP32's ADC range.

The current through the divider is:

\[ I_{divider} = \frac{V_{in}}{R_1 + R_2} = \frac{8.4V}{12.2k\Omega} \approx 0.69mA \]

This current draw is negligible compared to other components.

### LED Current Limiting

LEDs require current-limiting resistors to prevent damage. The resistor value is calculated as:

\[ R = \frac{V_{supply} - V_{LED}}{I_{LED}} \]

Where:
- V_{supply} = Supply voltage (3.3V from ESP32 GPIO)
- V_{LED} = LED forward voltage (typically 2.0V for red, 3.0V for white/blue)
- I_{LED} = Desired LED current (typically 20mA)

Example calculations:
- For red LED: R = (3.3V - 2.0V) / 0.02A = 65Ω (use 68Ω standard value)
- For white LED: R = (3.3V - 3.0V) / 0.02A = 15Ω (use 15Ω standard value)

For PWM brightness control, the average current is:

\[ I_{avg} = I_{max} \times \text{Duty Cycle} \]

### Motor Driver Operation

The L298N is a dual H-bridge motor driver that controls motor direction and speed:

- **Direction Control**: Using IN1/IN2 for left motors and IN3/IN4 for right motors
  - Forward: IN1=HIGH, IN2=LOW or IN3=HIGH, IN4=LOW
  - Backward: IN1=LOW, IN2=HIGH or IN3=LOW, IN4=HIGH
  - Stop: IN1=IN2=LOW or IN3=IN4=LOW

- **Speed Control**: Using ENA/ENB PWM signals
  - Duty cycle determines speed (0-100%)

L298N efficiency considerations:
- Voltage drop: ~1.5-2V across the driver
- Power dissipation: P = I² × R_{DS(on)}
- Thermal management: Heatsink recommended for currents >1A

### Signal Integrity

Signal integrity is crucial for reliable operation, especially for PWM and sensor signals:

1. **Ground loops**: Prevent by using a star grounding topology

2. **EMI from motors**: Mitigate with:
   - 0.1μF ceramic capacitors across motor terminals
   - Twisted pair wiring for motor connections
   - Physical separation of signal and power wires

3. **ADC noise reduction**:
   - Multiple sampling and averaging
   - Low-pass filtering (RC filter: R=10kΩ, C=0.1μF)
   - Software debouncing and filtering

4. **Digital signal protection**:
   - Pull-up/down resistors (10kΩ) on critical inputs
   - Schmitt trigger buffers for noisy environments

## Safety Engineering

### Failsafe Design Principles

Failsafe mechanisms ensure safe operation even during failures:

1. **Communication timeout**:
   - If no commands are received for >500ms, gradually stop motors
   - Re-establish control only after valid commands resume

2. **Watchdog timers**:
   - Hardware watchdog: Resets ESP32 if software hangs
   - Software watchdogs: Monitor critical tasks
