## Tips for Beginners

1. **Start with a kit**: Consider buying a robot car kit that includes the chassis, motors, and wheels to simplify the mechanical assembly.

2. **Buy extra components**: Especially for small items like resistors, LEDs, and jumper wires, having extras on hand is helpful when mistakes happen.

3. **Invest in good tools**: Quality tools will last longer and make the building process much easier. The soldering iron and multimeter are particularly important.

4. **Consider a breadboard setup first**: Before soldering everything permanently, test your circuits on a breadboard to ensure everything works as expected.

5. **Join online communities**: Forums and social media groups dedicated to ESP32 and robotics projects can provide valuable advice and troubleshooting help.

6. **Document your build**: Take photos and notes as you build, which will help if you need to troubleshoot or modify your project later.

7. **Safety first**: Always work with Li-ion batteries carefully, use proper eye protection when soldering, and ensure adequate ventilation.
